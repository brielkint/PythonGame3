Features
--------
1. Multiple Difficulty Levels
   - Easy: Basic programming concepts
   - Average: Intermediate programming terms
   - Hard: Advanced programming concepts

2. Scoring System
   - Time-based scoring
   - Difficulty multipliers:
     * Easy: 1x multiplier
     * Average: 1.5x multiplier
     * Hard: 2x multiplier
   - Points calculation: (100 - seconds_taken) × difficulty_multiplier

3. Progress Tracking
   - Games played counter
   - Best score tracking
   - Local storage for persistence

Technical Implementation
----------------------

1. Backend (app.py)
   - Framework: Flask
   - Main Routes:
     * / : Homepage with difficulty selection
     * /game : Game interface and question generation
     * /check : Answer verification endpoint
   
   - Game Data Structure:
     * Organized by difficulty levels
     * Each question contains:
       - Image reference
       - Correct word
       - Scrambled version

2. Frontend Components

   a) Homepage (homepage.html)
      - Modern UI with glassmorphism effects
      - 3D card animations
      - Responsive design
      - Progress statistics display

   b) Game Interface (index.html)
      - Timer implementation
      - Score tracking
      - Image display
      - Answer input
      - Auto-progression system

3. Game Mechanics

   a) Question Generation:
      - Random selection from difficulty pool
      - Word scrambling algorithm
      - Image-word pairing

   b) Answer Checking:
      - Case-insensitive comparison
      - Immediate feedback
      - Score calculation
      - Progress tracking

   c) Game Flow:
      1. User selects difficulty
      2. Questions are randomly selected
      3. Words are scrambled
      4. User inputs answer
      5. System checks answer
      6. Auto-proceeds on correct answer
      7. Updates score and progress
      8. Saves statistics

Responsive Design
---------------
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  * Small devices: max-width 480px
  * Tablets: 481px - 768px
  * Laptops: 769px - 1024px
  * Desktops: 1025px+
  * Ultra HD: 2560px+
